**How to use the Avan Data Portal?**
The Avan Data Portal provides an overview of the variables available in the Avan data lake. It is possible to view all available variables including their descriptions, select the variables of interest, and export the selection. It is important to be aware that the selected variables must be relevant according to the project description in the approved ethics application.

At the moment, it is possible to choose variables from five national registries (National Cancer Register, National Cause of Death Register, National In‑Patient Register, National Out‑Patient Register, National Prescribed Drug Register) and from the Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study (NSHDS). NSHDS variables are a selection made for PREDICT and only include variables from VIP and MONICA.

The Avan Data Portal is for now not an online service. The variables are chosen by clicking. All selected variables end up on a list (CSV file). When the variable selection is complete, the CSV file must be exported manually (and sent to research.predict@umu.se.
**NOTE!** **The selection persists only during the active session.** If you interrupt the session, you will have to redo the entire selection.

- Give Excel-file for off-line selection.
