info:
- "This dataset is an extract from the National Cancer Register, covering the period
  from 1958-01-01 to 2022-03-31. It includes all individuals in the Predict cohort
  who included in the National Cancer Register."
- "Date of extraction: 2025-02-25"
- "Official site: https://www.socialstyrelsen.se/statistik-och-data/register/cancerregistret/"
- "The National Board of Health and Welfare (Socialstyrelsen) provides a variable
  list online. Variable names correspond to the `colname_silver` value in Avan's internal
  codebook: https://www.socialstyrelsen.se/globalassets/sharepoint-dokument/dokument-webb/statistik/register-variabelforteckning-cancerregistret.xlsx"
info_internal:
- "PREDICT received a codebook (Excel) specific for this data extraction: 01_bronze/03_documentation/Variabellista_13819_2024.xlsx"
- "From personal correspondence with National Board of Health and Welfare; What is
  referred to in the Cancer Registry as `ICDO10`/`SNOMEDO10` corresponds to ICD-O-2
  and SNOMED2, but with certain elements of ICD-10. In practice, this means that hematological
  malignancies do not fall under C42 as they do according to ICD-O-2, but under their
  respective locations according to ICD-10. There is no edition of ICD-O-10 / SNOMED10."
- "Preliminary tests (without saving code or results) comparing this data with the
  Regional Cancer Register extract suggest that `ICDO10` in this dataset corresponds
  to `icdo2_code` in the RCC. Consequently, we have renamed `ICDO10`/`SNOMEDO10` to
  `icdo2_code`/`snomed2_code` to match the RCC data."
- "The topography part of ICD-O-2 and ICD-O-3 are specified to be identical (and equal
  to ICD10 chapter II), yet in this dataset there are observations where the two differ
  (`icdo2_code` != `icdo3_code`). ICD-O-3 is defined for the range C00.0 to C80.9.
  Most of the observations where ICD-O-2 and ICD-O-3 differ have ICD-O-2 values outside
  this range (C90.0-D47.3). Perhaps the out-of-range ICD-O-2 codes in part stem from
  the ICD-10 elements that are sprinkled in."
- "In some cases it is necessary to combine the values of multiple columns to obtain
  a combination that uniquely identifies an observation. To simplify unique referencing
  to specific observations we have created an internal observation identifier (avan_ridx);
  a row index that matches the rows in the original file."
