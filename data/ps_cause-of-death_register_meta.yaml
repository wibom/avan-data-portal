subtitle: "Data extract from the National Board of Health and Welfare (Socialstyrelsen)"
version: 1.0
info:
- "This dataset is an extract from the National Cause of Death Register, covering
  the period from 1958-01-01 to 2022-03-31. It includes all individuals in the Predict
  cohort with a record in the register within this time span."
- "Date of extraction: 2025-02-24"
- "Official site: https://www.socialstyrelsen.se/statistik-och-data/register/dodsorsaksregistret/"
- "The National Board of Health and Welfare (Socialstyrelsen) provides a variable
  list online. Variable names correspond to the `colname_silver` value in Avan's internal
  codebook: https://www.socialstyrelsen.se/globalassets/sharepoint-dokument/dokument-webb/statistik/register-dodsorsaksregistret-variabelforteckning.xls"
- "ICD code descriptions and hierarchical groupings included in this dataset are based
  on in-house translations and mappings. While we rely on official sources — including
  the National Board of Health and Welfare (ICD-10-SE, downloaded 2025-03-20) and
  the CDC ICD-9-CM archive (downloaded 2025-04-01) — users are encouraged to verify
  all annotations independently. In particular, the CDC ICD-9-CM data was provided
  in RTF format and parsed using custom code, which may introduce errors despite our
  best efforts. Responsibility for analytical decisions based on these annotations
  ultimately rests with the user. For reference: - ICD-10-SE: https://www.socialstyrelsen.se/globalassets/sharepoint-dokument/dokument-webb/klassifikationer-och-koder/icd-10-se.tsv
  - CDC archive: https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/nchs/icd/icd9cm.htm - CDC archive

- "The dataset contains up to 17 contributing causes of death in the variables `cod_contributing_01`
  – `cod_contributing_17` (renamed from `MORSAK1` – `MORSAK17`). These hold all diagnoses
  listed on the death-certificate in addition to the underlying cause. Precise *priority*
  or *placement* on the certificate cannot be reconstructed from the current extract,
  because the RO-variables (`RO1` – `RO48`) — which encode the certificate row and
  ordinal position (e.g., `RO1 = 101` --> terminal cause in `cod_contributing_01`;
  `RO2 = 602` --> second listed contributing cause in `cod_contributing_02`) — were
  not part of our order. According to guidance from the National Board of Health and
  Welfare, the first digit of an RO code indicates the line on the certificate (rows
  1–4 form the causal chain, row 6 lists other contributing causes). A sample certificate
  illustrating this layout is available at: <https://www.socialstyrelsen.se/globalassets/sharepoint-dokument/artikelkatalog/foreskrifter-och-allmanna-rad/bilaga6-dodsorsaksintyg.pdf>.
  The Predict project is currently submitting an additional application to obtain
  the RO-variables; future releases will therefore allow full reconstruction of the
  certificate´s ordering of contributing causes."
info_internal:
- "PREDICT received a codebook (Excel) specific for this data extraction: 01_bronze/03_documentation/Variabellista_13819_2024.xlsx"
- "Transforming this dataset involved: **Dropping unused columns**: Variables `MORSAK18`
  to `MORSAK48` were removed, as no records contained more than 17 multiple causes
  of death. **Fixing invalid dates**: Death dates (`DODSDAT`) with missing day or
  month components (coded as `'00'`) were replaced with `'01'` to allow date parsing
  and age calculation. **Cleaning ICD codes**: A leading hyphen (`-`), historically
  used for additional diagnoses in multiple cause-of-death fields, was removed from
  `ULORSAK` and all `MORSAK` variables. This change is documented and justified via
  correspondence with the National Board of Health and Welfare."
- "A small set of full-length `cod_underlying_code` ICD-10 codes were identified as
  invalid based on the ICD-10-SE lookup (22 unique codes, affecting 126 records).
  All were valid at the three-character level. Original code values are kept in the
  processed data. Only valid codes can be further annotated. Similarly, two `cod_underlying_code`
  ICD-9 codes (affecting 3 records) were flagged as invalid (`'888'` and `'_AVI_'`).
  These values are replaced by `NA` in the processed data."
