title: "NSHDS Questionnaires"
subtitle: "NSHSA Questionnaire Responses, Blood Measurements, and Anthropometric Data
  on all Participants in the Predict Cohort."
info: "This dataset includes data from questionnaires and measurements taken during
  visits to healthcare centers as part of the Västerbotten Intervention Programme
  (VIP). VIP is a cohort within the Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study (NSHDS).
  Residents of Västerbotten County are invited to general health examinations at 10-year
  intervals, specifically at the ages of 40, 50, and 60."
info_internal:
- "Until further notice, data may not be shared with researchers."
- "Linking the questionnaire data with donated blood samples is done by matching on
  `avanid` and `questionnaire_date`. According to BRS convention, date matching is
  performed within a standard interval of +/- 31 days."
- "Many variables originally contained codes (i.e., '5555', '6666', '7777', '8888',
  '9999') representing different reasons for data missingness. Since these values
  cannot be included in analyses, we extracted this information into separate columns
  during data tidying. These new columns were named after the original columns with
  the suffix `*_missingkey`, resulting in a total of 74 new columns."
